2005/08/25 GR  - Target Release: ????
        * Totals values of matching engine are not summing up
        - missing OneSideds and Duplicates
        
        * Not processed values like Duplicates and Onesideds should be 
        printed to an extra file.
        
        * Configuration of the system for ftp and sftp.
        In general everything could be done with OA.
        Problem: Configuration must be done inthe OA props files
        - in the past the configuration of that was done in the gprops.
        Solution:
        a) Generate the necessary part of OA props from the gprops
           (if the point of view is the reconciliation)
        b) Generate file info for gprops from OA props files
           (if the point of view is from the OA)
           
        * Write User Doc
        
        * Write Developer Doc
        
        * move utility modules (from the Gass directory like version.pm, error.pm) in another directory
		src/

			perl/
				utils/
				Grass/
					auxiliary/
