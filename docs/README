                      Documentation for OpenGrass
                      ============================

OpenGrass documentation is a work in progress but will hopefully fill
as time goes by


A rough guide:

  programmer/                Documents for OpenGrass programmers.

  programmer/design/         OpenGrass design documents

  programmer/change.log      All changes as and when they are made
                             with release notes.


  user/                      Documents for OpenGrass users.


If you'd like to document a new feature, try to find a place for it
somewhere in book/misc-docs.
